# wsh_marc2003

Get the official component here: https://code.google.com/p/foo-wsh-panel-mod/downloads/list

If you know what you're doing, you can use my modded version: https://github.com/19379/foo_uie_wsh_panel_mod/releases

After installing, make sure **Safe mode** is disabled. (File>Preferences>Tools>WSH Panel Mod)

Download the zip file from the link just to the right. Extract folder contents in to your foobar2000 profile folder, 
usually located at **%appdata%\foobar2000**. If using portable mode then the folder should go inside the main
foobar2000 folder. Rename the folder so it's named **wsh_marc2003**

Add a WSH panel to your layout. Check your UI documentation for how to do this. Right click the panel>**Configure**
and replace the editor contents with the text of any sample you'd like to try from the **wsh_marc2003\samples** folder.

The **Last.fm Artist Info - User Charts - Recommended artists** script requires your own Last.fm API KEY which
you can acquire from this page: http://www.last.fm/api/accounts 

While the API KEY has to be set inside the script, all other script configuration options can be found
on the right click menu.

I'm not taking feature requests and I'm not restoring any scripts or features missing from previous packages. Genuine bugs can be reported here:
